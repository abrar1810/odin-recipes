# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin Project where I have to create a website that will display 3 recipes.

The main page will include 3 relative links that will direct you to each of these recipes. They show a title, image, ingredients and the steps to make it.

The skills I've acquired from this project:

- Proper use of basic HTML (headings, paragraphs, relative links, unordered/ordered lists, images)
- Better understanding of basic git commands (git add, commit, push, push origin main)
- Better knowledge on how to set out my commit messages.
